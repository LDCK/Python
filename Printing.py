#Printing messages in Python

#Option 1 - Declare Variables and then add them together
first = "Hello "
second = "World"
    #storing "Hello" + "World" as 2 separate variables 
result = first + second
    #Creating a new variable which contains both the first and second variables - Hello + World
print(result, "Lee")
    #Printing Hello World + Lee - Any text would work
    #This is the long way to achieve the below

#Option 2 - Declare a variable and then print it
message = "Hello in return"
print(message)

#Option 3 - Prints a string (message) without declaring a variable
print("Hello AGAIN")

#Printing what type of operators are being used.
my_baby_bool = "true"
print(type(my_baby_bool))

my_baby_bool_two = True
print(type(my_baby_bool_two))
